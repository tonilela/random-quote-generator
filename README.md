# Tech Stack

## Backend:

Fastify (Node.js framework)

TypeScript

PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM

GraphQL with Mercurius

JWT Authentication

Docker

## Frontend:

React

TypeScript

Docker

## Quick Start

Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose

### Git

Clone the Repository

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd random-quote-generator
```

Environment Setup
Copy the environment example file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

The .env file contains all necessary configuration for Docker Compose including database credentials, API URLs, and JWT secrets.

Start the Application
Build and start all services:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will:

* Build the backend (Fastify API)
* Build the frontend (React app)
* Start PostgreSQL database
* Set up networking between services

### Seed the Database

After containers are running, populate the database with quotes:

```
docker-compose exec server npm run seed
```

This will fetch and store 1400+ quotes from the DummyJSON API.

Access the Application
Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

Backend API: `http://localhost:3001`

GraphiQL Interface: `http://localhost:3001/graphiql`

Database: localhost:5433 (PostgreSQL).

# Development Commands

#### View logs

```
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Stop services

```
docker-compose down
```

#### Rebuild specific service

```
docker-compose up --build server
```

#### Access backend container

Docker Services
db: PostgreSQL database

server: Fastify backend API

client: React frontend application

Complete Reset
To start completely fresh:

##### Remove all containers, images, and volumes

```
docker-compose down --rmi all -v --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a -f
```

##### Rebuild everything

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

##### Re-seed database

```
docker-compose exec server npm run seed
```
